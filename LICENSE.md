In essence, you are encouraged to contribute at least one of two ways (as is available to you): either by publishing changes and/or additions to the project itself, or by supporting my past work as well as any future contributions to the project.

## Do I need a private license?

If Mundialis is of use to you and you are able, I would appreciate if you would support me (even a small amount is appreciated!), *especially* if you profit from its existence.

This won't cover every use-case, but hopefully should provide some clarity into what does or does not require a private license (including patron and any other custom licenses):

- I set up *Mundialis* locally or on a webserver and use it to store world, etc. information for a noncommercial endeavor. I do not modify its source code.
    - No private license necessary.
- I use *Mundialis* as part of a commercial endeavor, but do not modify it.
    - No private license necessary. However, as mentioned above, I strongly request that you support me in return!
- I use *Mundialis* for either a commercial or noncommercial endeavor, and modify its functionality to better suit my needs. I publish it as specified in [the Parity License](LICENSE-PARITY.md#Contribute).
    - No private license necessary. Consider making a pull request to this repository if your changes are broadly applicable so that they may be readily incorporated into the project itself!
- I am an individual and/or single-developer company, and I want to use *Mundialis* and make changes (including but not limited to building a non-open-source project or product) but not publish them.
    - Yes, you need a private license; in this case a [Patron License](LICENSE-PATRON.md) will do.
- I represent a larger company, and I want to use *Mundialis* and make changes (including but not limited to building a non-open-source project or product) but not publish them.
    - You'll need a custom private license; [contact me](mailto:queries@itinerare.net?subject=Mundialis%20license)!
- I want to create an open-source project or product on top of *Mundialis*.
    - No private license required; however, you will need to include and comply with *Mundialis*' license when distributing your project and ensure users of your project are aware of the same.
- I want to create a non-open-source project or product on top of *Mundialis*.
    - You will need a private license.
